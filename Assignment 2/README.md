## Assignment 2

Topics: Inheritance, polymorphism

In this assignment, we model parts of a small economy, namely the food service industry. We model places where customers can buy food: restaurants, food stands, and fast food. We model the payment of bills, including sales tax and tip. We do not model many other things such as the food or menu. We also model a tax collector who
collects both sales tax and income tax. We only model one year: the workers each have some income and pay tax for that year. 

Here are a UML diagram for FoodPlace classes and subclasses.

Letâ€™s next look at the various types of people who work in these food places. These people all are income tax payers.

We are now ready for our last three classes which are shown in these UML class diagrams:
