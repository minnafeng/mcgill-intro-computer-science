## Assignment 3

Topics: Recursion, tertiary search tree (TST), Iterator

You will work with a data structure that we will call a tertiary search tree or TST.1 This is like a binary
search tree (BST), except that each node in a TST has three children rather than two. We can call the three
children left, middle, and right. Each node stores a element whose class type implements Comparable,
so you can assume access to a compareTo() method. The subtrees defined by the left, middle, and right
children of a node have elements that are less than, equal to, or greater than the element at that node,
respectively.

You will implement similar methods for your TST class.
